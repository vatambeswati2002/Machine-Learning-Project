Project Title
This project focuses on analyzing a startup dataset to predict the success or growth potential of startups based on various features such as funding amount, industry type, team size, and market location. The primary goal is to improve prediction accuracy by experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameter tuning..

Overview
This project explores a dataset containing information about startups, including features such as their spending on R&D, administration, marketing, and profit generation. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the profit of startups based on these key variables, and to enhance the accuracy of predictions by implementing and comparing multiple algorithms.

By leveraging this dataset, the project aims to:

Understand the relationship between different factors contributing to a startup's success.
Use machine learning to predict the profitability of startups accurately.
Experiment with techniques such as feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced algorithms to improve model performance.
Key steps include:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical data).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns.
Comparing different algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest,Logistic Regression & XGBoost,KNN & Support Vector Machine.
Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.
Tuning models to optimize their performance.
This project not only builds foundational knowledge of machine learning but also focuses on practical techniques for improving accuracy, making it suitable for real-world applications in startup analysis.
